### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas and I have been a Software Developer since 2010. I have over 8 years working with PHP and over 5 years working with the Laravel framework. On the frontend I have been working with Vue.js/React for the past 4 years.

Throughout my journey I've been working with monitoring and maintenance of linux servers, also worked with server automation with Python and Bash Script. Currently I'm a rest API's development specialist, working with backend stacks such as PHP/Laravel/Lumen and NodeJs/Typescript. I have strong experience with object-oriented development with PHP, as well as in TypeScript/Javascript.
