### Welcome! 👋

My name is Lucas and I have been a Software Developer since 2010. I have over 6 years working with PHP and over 4 years working with the Laravel framework. On the frontend I have been working with Vue.js for the past 3 years.

Throughout my journey I have been working with monitoring and maintenance of linux servers, also worked with server automation with Python and Bash Script. Currently I am specializing in PHP rest apis development.

As a recent challenge as well I started to work on projects with Nodejs on the backend and React on the frontend.
